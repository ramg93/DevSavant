# Python Exercise

## Read a database from a JSON file containing players' info. These information is Name, Lastname, height in meters and height in inches. 
## Write a function with a target height (integer) as an input that will find the pair(s) of players whose summed heights in inches matches the given target height. 

## Try it on you own. I share my solution in the next cells. 

## Running the following cell will generate a ```app.py``` file which can be executed from console by running ```python app.py``` once the workdirectory is placed where the file is and the evironment ```DevSavant``` is set and active. 

## Otherwire, if you mean to run the code inside this jupyter notebook, just comment the first line: ```%%writefile app.py```

## An ```environment.yml``` file is added to better suit the exectution of this repo. It's encouraged to set it up and activate it. 

## The ```app.py``` file can be executed on console and it will return the pairs of players whose heights sum a given target height. The default value is 139. 

## The jupyter notebook contains the generation of the ```app.py``` file and the code poised to be further tested and modified. 

## Hope you enjoy!
